Attitude Kinematics in Python
=======================

``kinematics`` is Python package to perform attitude kinematics.
It is written completely in Python and only requires ``numpy`` as a runtime 
dependency.


Installation
============

Install ``kinematics`` by running : ``pip install kinematics`` to install from pypi

To install a development version (for local testing), you can clone the 
repository and run ``pip install -e .`` from the source directory.

Documentation
=============

Docs will be hosted on Read the Docs

Update travis to do the build, install, and test for both pypi install and conda install

Citing ``kinematics``
================

If you find this package useful, it would be very helpful to cite it in your work.
You can find a citation link above.

Dependencies
============

The only hard dependency is on ``numpy``. 
All vectors and operations utilize the numerical tools of numpy.
You should already have it installed, ``pip install numpy``.
